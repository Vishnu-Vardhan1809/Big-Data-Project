#### b) Communication plan to include project artifact repository:
    Methods of communication :- e-mail, Whatsapp(once a week)
    Communication response times:- Same day

    Meeting attendance:- After looking into everyone’s schedule we had decided to meet weekly once virtual to discuss the progress of the project 
    and complete the required things and meet the deliverable requirements.

    Running meetings:- Virtual.

## 2. Selection of data to analyze from:
    We looked at the information and data for our project. We'll be using a dataset called "2021 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science survey" from a 
    website called Kaggle\competitions. We'll study this dataset to see how it's set up and what it contains, and then use that information to 
    figure out some results.

## 3. Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem or opportunity):
    
    

    With the growing rate of data, the demand to hire data scientists in the market also increases. So to get a better understanding of the
    people that break into the field of data and the requirement to meet today’s market's expectation to deliver the project as early as 
    possible with high accuracy, we need predictive analysis of people who pursuing data science and machine learning job and what are the 
    certain features that some of them have that make them as greater potential in the job market.

    The dataset contains a complete industry-wide survey that represents information about job seekers including the age, level of their education, skill sets,             carrier, and origin. It has around 10,000 rows and 369 futures, and the data scheme is the following:
    
    ### Business Problem or Opportunity:
        1. How does the level of education of job seekers in the field of data science and machine learning correlate with their salary and job opportunities
        2. What are the most common career backgrounds of people who transition into data science and machine learning jobs
        3. Are there any specific skills or programming languages that are more desirable for data science and machine learning jobs in the current job market

## 4. Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)
    1) Predicting the salary of a data professional based on their job title, years of experience, and
       location?
    2) What are the most important skills for data professionals to have in the current job market, and how do these vary by job title and industry?
    3) What are the most common tools and platforms used by data professionals, and how does
       their usage vary by job title, industry, and experience level?
    4) How does the compensation of data professionals vary by job title, industry, and years of experience?
    5) What is the distribution of job titles and their salaries among data professionals who have a PhD?
    6) Analyzing  and visualizing the degrees and the job roles based on the survey results.
    7) Which degree has the highest number of job opportunities in the field of data science based on the person's educational background?
    8) Determining the number of individuals working in the field of data science in each country, we can evaluate which countries offer more opportunities in this            field or are suitable for establishing a data science company.
    9) Analyzing the usage patterns of various platforms within the field of data science, we can gain insights from the experiences of those involved. This                  information can then be used to develop new initiatives aimed at improving the overall situation.
